# AI Agent Guidelines

This document establishes the operational guidelines for AI Agents working on this project. All agents must adhere to these rules.

## 1. Localization & Language
- **Agent Output**: All artifacts, task lists, plans, walkthroughs, and chat responses generated by the agent MUST be in **Japanese**.
- **Code & UI**: 
    - Follow the existing language patterns of the codebase.
    - Do not arbitrarily translate existing English UI elements to Japanese unless explicitly requested.
    - For new features, match the language of the surrounding code/UI.

## 2. Artifact Management
- Maintain `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, and `walkthrough.md` as living documents.
- Ensure these documents are always written in **Japanese**.

## 3. Code Style
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns.
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS as per the project setup.
